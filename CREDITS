Lilina 1.0:
	* Ryan McCue <cubegames@gmail.com>
		Me :) I rewrote alot of the code from scratch
		and took over the project
	* Panayotis Vryonis <panayotis@vrypan.net>
		0.7 and below, the rest of the code
	* Jean-Marc Liotier <jim@liotier.org>
		Code for RSS output, based on example code from
		FeedCreator

Software used:
--------------
cache.php:
	* Dave Childs
		Thanks to Dave for the caching method used in cache.php
		and for all the cheatsheets which I use rigourously :D

HTMLPurifier:
	* Edward Z. Yang (Ambush Commander)
	* (From HTMLPurifier credits)
		Lots of thanks to the DevNetwork Community for their
		help (see docs/ref-devnetwork.html for more details),
		Feyd especially (namely IPv6 and optimization).  Thanks
		to RSnake for letting me package his fantastic XSS
		cheatsheet for a smoketest.

MagpieRSS:
	* Kellan Elliott-McCrea <kellan@pobox.com>
		Kellan recently rewrote his popular parser from the ground up.
		Lilina uses the 2.0-alpha-alpha-alpha, the first version
		of this rewritten code.
		Without MagpieRSS at the start, Lilina would not exist.
		ALL HAIL KELLAN!
