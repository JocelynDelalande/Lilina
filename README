Lilina News Aggregator - Readme
===============================

Welcome!                    {#welcome}
--------
Welcome and thanks for downloading Lilina! This file is designed to give you a guide into the installation and use of the Lilina News Aggregator software. Please note that readme.html is probably more up-to-date than this file.


Requirements                {#requirements}
------------
- A webserver, like Apache or IIS
- PHP 4.0.2+
- Support for socket connections (see <http://php.net/manual/en/function.fsockopen.php>)
- Support for fopen wrappers (see <http://au.php.net/manual/en/ref.filesystem.php#ini.allow-url-fopen>)

That's it! No PEAR packages are needed and no MySQL, PostgreSQL or SQLite databases are needed. Lilina is fully self-contained and uses flat-files instead of databases.


Installation                {#installation}
------------
Extract Lilina into your web root folder. Upload to your server and then open up install.php in your browser to begin the installation process


Permissions                 {#permissions}
-----------
To use Lilina, you will need to make sure that both your `cache/` and `conf/` directories are writable. You can set the proper permissions using:

	chmod -R 0755 cache conf

If that does not work, you will need to give the folder world writable permissions. This is not recommended as it is then possible for anyone to edit your files. You can set it by executing:

	chmod -R 0777 cache conf

If you use a graphical FTP client, you can also set it on each folder using the number 755 or 777, or giving read and execute permissions to all and the write permission to the owner only
